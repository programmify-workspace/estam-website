# ESTAM University Official Website

Welcome to the ESTAM University Official Website project. Here are some guidelines to follow while working on this project:

## Collaboration

Remember that you are not the only one working on this project. Therefore, it is important to be cautious when editing certain files. Specifically, index.js in the root directory, and all CSS and JS files. Avoid changing the names of existing variables and functions in the JavaScript files and the names of selectors in the CSS files. However, you are allowed to create new variables and functions in the JavaScript files and new selectors in the CSS files.

## Branches

Do not push buggy code to the staging branch. Treat the staging branch as if it were the main branch. If you need more freedom to work on the project without fear of breaking anything, create your own branch to work on, and only pull request to staging branch once you've confirmed that your changes are stable.

## Critical Changes

Critical changes such as deleting a file, folder or project must be authorized by the CEO.

## Updates

Always keep your local main branch updated with the changes on the main branch in the remote repository. Use git fetch and git pull to handle this task.

## Folder Structure

Follow the existing folder structure. For example, add images to the public/assets/images directory and add JavaScript files to the public/assets/js directory. Do not create a separate folder for any file unless that file folder hasn't been created yet.

## Design Guidelines

Follow the color code, layout, and responsive design style of the website. Here are the specific colors to use:

Primary color: #47499A
Secondary color: #EE4A62
Accent color: #f8941A

## Rest

Do not code when you are tired. Take a break, get some rest or sleep, and come back when you are refreshed.
